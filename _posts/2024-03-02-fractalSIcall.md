Dear Colleagues,

Recently, methods based on the use of complex systems have been widely used in image analysis and pattern recognition. These methods work to analyze the organization of and interaction between the elements present in the data, such as pixels, superpixels, or objects in images and videos. To undertake such tasks, they consider concepts and approaches to complex systems, such as fractal dimension and descriptors, entropy, deterministic or random walks, complex networks or graphs, cellular automata, among others. These approaches share the ability to describe the irregularity or homogeneity of structures with a high degree of precision. This information is relevant for the functioning of both natural and artificial vision systems, helping in the accurate analysis of images, especially those extracted from nature, medical imaging or non-linear phenomena.

We invite researchers to submit their original work, as well as review articles that discuss recent developments and applications in image analysis and pattern recognition. Submissions should draw on approaches from fractal descriptors and complex systems.

The scope and topics that are invited for submission include (but are not limited to):

- Fractal dimension and descriptors in image analysis;
- Fractal in neural networks;
- Complex systems methods in image processing and analysis;
- Complex systems methods in machine learning;
- Complex systems in neural networks and deep learning;
- Applications of complex systems and fractal methods in biology, medicine, etc.

<h2 id="header-2">Manuscript Submission Information</h2>

Manuscripts should be submitted online at <a href="www.mdpi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.mdpi.com</a> by registering and logging in to this website. Once you are registered, <a href="https://susy.mdpi.com/user/manuscripts/upload/?journal=fractalfract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click here to</a> go to the submission form. Manuscripts can be submitted until the deadline. All submissions that pass pre-check are peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue website. Research articles, review articles as well as short communications are invited. For planned papers, a title and short abstract (about 100 words) can be sent to the Editorial Office for announcement on this website.

Submitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere (except conference proceedings papers). All manuscripts are thoroughly refereed through a single-blind peer-review process. A guide for authors and other relevant information for submission of manuscripts is available on the Instructions for Authors page. Fractal and Fractional is an international peer-reviewed open access monthly journal published by MDPI.

Please visit the Instructions for Authors page before submitting a manuscript. The Article Processing Charge (APC) for publication in this open access journal is 2700 CHF (Swiss Francs). Submitted papers should be well formatted and use good English. Authors may use MDPI's English editing service prior to publication or during author revisions.
